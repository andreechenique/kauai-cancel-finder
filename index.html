    <title>Kauai Vacation Rental Tracker - Find Last-Minute Cancellations</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Just remember, you were hoping to go on that vacation, but unfortunately, there's no availability anywhere because someone else booked ahead of you. But what if their plans changed and they canceled? How would you find out about that? This is where CancelScout comes in. It will notify you instantly when vacation rentals that were previously unavailable become available. You can monitor Airbnb, VRBO, and hotels for cancellations and new availability in real time.">
